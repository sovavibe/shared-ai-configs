# /implement - Execute Plan from Beads

When user says `/implement beads-XXX` or "implement beads-XXX":

## 1. Load the Plan

```bash
bd show beads-XXX
```

Read the plan carefully. It contains:

- Summary and architecture decisions
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Files to create/modify
- Acceptance criteria

## 2. Check Context (Optional)

```bash
# Check hindsight for additional context
mcp__hindsight-alice__recall "beads-XXX plan context"
```

## 3. Start Implementation

```bash
# Mark as in progress
bd update beads-XXX --status=in_progress
```

## 4. Follow the Plan

For each step in "Implementation Steps":

1. Read the step description
2. Implement exactly as specified
3. Check off mentally as you complete

**Guidelines:**

- Follow the architecture decision from the plan
- Create/modify files as listed in the plan
- Don't deviate from the plan without asking
- If blocked, note it and continue with other steps

## 5. Verify Acceptance Criteria

Before closing, verify ALL acceptance criteria are met:

- [ ] Run tests if applicable
- [ ] Check that all files were created/modified
- [ ] Verify the feature works as described

## 6. Complete

```bash
# Close the bead
bd close beads-XXX --reason="Implemented as planned"

# Sync (MANDATORY before commit)
bd sync --flush-only
```

## 7. Report Back

Output summary:

```
✅ Implemented: beads-XXX
📁 Files changed: [list]
🧪 Tests: [pass/fail/none]
📝 Notes: [any deviations or issues]
```
