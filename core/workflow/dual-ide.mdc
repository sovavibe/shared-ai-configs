# Dual IDE Workflow: Claude Code + Cursor

## Split SDLC Between IDEs

| SDLC Phase | IDE | Model | Use When |
|-----------|-----|-------|----------|
| **Analyze** | Claude Code | **Opus** | Breaking down requirements, understanding scope |
| **Architect** | Claude Code | **Opus** | Design decisions, system architecture, deep analysis |
| **Plan** | Claude Code | Sonnet | Detailed planning, TodoWrite, task breakdown |
| **Implement** | **Cursor** | Agent mode | Code generation, fast iterations, automode |
| **Review** | Claude Code | **Opus** | Code quality, security review, Snyk integration |
| **Fix Issues** | Claude Code → Cursor | Opus → Agent | Analysis in Opus, implementation in Cursor |

## Key Principles

- **Critical thinking** (architecture, analysis, deep review) = **Claude Code** (Opus or PAL tools)
- **Implementation** (writing code, tests, iterating) = **Cursor automode**
- **Planning** (breaking down, TodoWrite) = **Claude Code Sonnet**

## Why Split?

- **Claude Code Opus:** Best for analysis, architecture, decision-making (context awareness, reasoning depth)
- **Cursor Agent:** Best for implementation, iteration, code generation (speed, reflex reactions)
- **Synergy:** Complex analysis in Claude Code → optimized code generation in Cursor

## IDE Synchronization Rules

1. **Rules Parity:** All rules from `.cursor/rules/` apply to both IDEs
2. **Git Workflow:** Both IDEs use stealth mode (no auto-push, no auto-commit)
3. **Beads Integration:** Both IDEs use `BD_ENABLED=1` for issue tracking
4. **Quality Gates:** Both IDEs enforce `npm run quality:gates` before commit
5. **Changes Sync:** Updates to `.cursor/rules/` must be reflected in `.claude/` documentation

## Context Handoff Protocol

When switching between IDEs, use structured handoff:

```yaml
# .claude/context-handoff/current.md
phase: "implementation"
task_id: "beads-xyz"
scope: "Only modify src/pages/auth/ - don't touch generated API"
api_contract: "docs/API-CONTRACT.md"
test_plan: "docs/TEST-PLAN.md"
```

## Model Selection Strategy

### Opus (Direct - quick decisions with full context)

- ✅ Quick architectural decisions when you have all context
- ✅ Initial code review pass
- ✅ Rapid bug triage
- ✅ Security spot-checks

### Sonnet/Haiku (for standard work)

- ✅ Implementation
- ✅ Test writing
- ✅ Code generation
- ✅ Routine refactoring

### PAL Tools (external models for complex reasoning)

- ✅ Multi-model consensus for architecture decisions
- ✅ Deep investigation with `thinkdeep`
- ✅ Code review validation with `codereview`
- ✅ Complex debugging with `debug`
- ✅ Pre-commit validation with `precommit`

**Rule:** Use PAL for tasks that benefit from external model perspective or multi-model consensus. Use local Opus for quick decisions where you already have full context.
